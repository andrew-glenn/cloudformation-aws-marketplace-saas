This Quick Start provides the following deployment options:

* A full deployment option that supports both contracts and subscriptions. This option provides all required services to manage both contract entitlements and metered usage.
* A contracts-only deployment that provides only the resources required to manage contract entitlements.
* A subscriptions-only deployment that provides only the resources required to manage subscription-based metered usage.

The Quick Start provides a single template that includes all three deployment options.
