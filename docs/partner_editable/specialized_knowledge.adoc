This deployment guide requires a moderate level of familiarity with AWS services. If you’re new to AWS, refer to the https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/[Getting Started Resource Center^].

This Quick Start also assumes familiarity with AWS Marketplace and the SaaS product listing process. An existing SaaS listing and the associated product code is required to complete the deployment. To learn more about SaaS listing processes, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/saas-products.html[Software as a service (SaaS)–based products^] in the AWS Marketplace Seller Guide.
